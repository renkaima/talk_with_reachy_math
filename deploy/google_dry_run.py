"""Rehearse the Google Drive half of Talk with Reachy Math on a Mac, without a robot.

1. Signs in to Google with a device code (the same sign-in the robot uses) and
   writes connection_check.txt to My Drive > Talk with Reachy Math.
2. Logs a two-line fake conversation with the app's own study logger and stops
   it, which triggers the app's own final upload.
3. Confirms the transcript and its CSV timeline reached Google Drive.

The sign-in is saved in ~/.config/talk_with_reachy_math/google_token.json on this Mac,
which is what the app uses when it runs in the Reachy Mini Control simulation.
Run through google_dry_run.sh.
