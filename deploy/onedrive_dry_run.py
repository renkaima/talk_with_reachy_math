"""Rehearse the OneDrive half of Talk with Reachy Math on a laptop, without a robot.

1. Signs in to Microsoft in the browser (the same sign-in the robot needs) and
   writes connection_check.txt to OneDrive/Apps/Talk with Reachy Math/.
2. Logs a two-line fake conversation with the app's own study logger and
   stops it, which triggers the app's own final upload.
3. Confirms the finished transcript and its CSV timeline reached OneDrive.

The sign-in is saved in ~/.config/talk_with_reachy_math/onedrive_token_cache.json, which
copy_login_to_robot.sh can later copy to the robot so it never needs its own sign-in.
Run through onedrive_dry_run.sh.
